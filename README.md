This android application displays a list of recipes along with preparation steps including video taken from an API.


### Getting Started

You will need to install the app and run the application. Make sure you have strong internet connection for the recipe videos to load.


### Testing

This app uses "Espresso" for testing purposes. I have created one test which ensures that the button click goes to the correct activity.


### Acknowledgements

This is the third project created as a learning project for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree, 2018.
